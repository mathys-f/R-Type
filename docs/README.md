# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Local Development

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
npm build
npm serve
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

Then you can use `serve` to deploy it.
