                    Network RFC for R-Type Protocol
                         draft-pintard-rtype-00

Abstract

   This document describes the R-Type Protocol (RTP), a custom binary
   application-layer protocol designed for real-time multiplayer gaming.
   RTP provides a hybrid reliability model over UDP, supporting both
   unreliable high-frequency state updates and reliable control messages
   through a custom acknowledgment system.  This document defines the
   packet structure, serialization rules, reliability mechanisms, and
   command definitions required for interoperability between Client and
   Server implementation.

1.  Introduction

   The R-Type project requires a high-performance networking
   architecture capable of handling fast-paced arcade gameplay.
   Standard TCP implementations introduce Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking
   and Nagle’s algorithm delays, which are unsuitable for real-time
   entity synchronization.

   The R-Type Protocol (RTP) is designed to run exclusively over UDP
   (User Datagram Protocol).  To mitigate the inherent unreliability of
   UDP, RTP implements a lightweight application-layer reliability
   mechanism (RUDP) for critical data, while allowing transient game
   state data to remain unreliable for maximum throughput.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Data Representation

2.1.  Byte Ordering

   All multi-byte numeric fields (uint16, uint32, float) MUST be
   serialized in *Little Endian* byte order.  This decision aligns with
   the native architecture of modern gaming platforms (x86_64 and
   ARM64), facilitating "Zero-Copy" deserialization strategies.

2.2.  Structure Alignment

   All data structures transmitted over the network MUST be packed with
   1-byte alignment (#pragma pack(1)) to prevent compiler-inserted
   padding bytes from altering the packet size.

3.  Protocol Header Structure

   Every UDP datagram transmitted by either Client or Server MUST begin
   with the following 16-byte fixed header.

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

3.1.  Field Definitions

   *  *Magic Number (16 bits):* MUST be 0xD1CE.  This serves as a
      protocol identifier and a sanity check against random network
      noise.  Packets with invalid magic numbers MUST be dropped
      immediately.

Internet-Draft                   R-Type                    November 2025


   *  *Command ID (8 bits):* Identifies the type of payload (e.g.,
      Login, Move, Shoot).

   *  *Flags (8 bits):* A bitmask defining packet behavior.

      -  0x01 (RELIABLE): The receiver MUST send an acknowledgment.

      -  0x02 (IS_FRAGMENT): The payload is part of a larger message.

      -  0x03 (IS_ACK): The packet is an acknowledgment; payload is
         empty.

      - 0x04 (IS_ERROR): The packet indicates an error condition. The
         payload contains an error code and message.

   *  *Sequence ID (32 bits):* A monotonic counter incremented by the
      sender for every new packet.  Used for ordering and loss
      detection.

   *  *Ack ID (32 bits):* The Sequence ID of the last valid reliable
      packet received by the sender.

   *  *Fragment ID (16 bits):* A unique identifier grouping fragmented
      chunks.

   *  *Frag Index (8 bits):* The current chunk index (0 to N).

   *  *Total Frags (8 bits):* The total number of chunks.

   *  *Payload Size (16 bits):* The size of the data following the
      header, in bytes.

    *  *Checksum (16 bits):* A simple checksum (e.g., CRC16) covering
       the entire packet (header + payload) for data integrity
       verification. (the checksum field is set to 0 during checksum
       calculation).

4.  Reliability Mechanism

   The protocol implements a selective reliability layer.

4.1.  Unreliable Transmission

   Packets with the RELIABLE flag unset (0) are "Fire-and-Forget".
   These are used for high-frequency data such as Entity Position
   Updates (60Hz).  If such a packet is lost, no action is taken.

4.2.  Reliable Transmission

   Packets with the RELIABLE flag set (1) MUST be acknowledged. 1.
   *Sender:* MUST store the packet in a "Sent Queue" with a timestamp.
   2.  *Receiver:* Upon receiving a Reliable packet, MUST send a
   response packet with CommandID = ACK (0xFF) and the Ack ID set to the
   received packet's Sequence ID. 3.  *Retransmission:* If the sender
   does not receive an ACK within *200ms*, it MUST resend the packet.

5.  Fragmentation

   The Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) safe limit is defined as *1400
   bytes*. Payloads exceeding this size MUST be fragmented.

   1.  The payload is split into chunks of 1004 bytes.

   2.  Each chunk is sent as a separate packet with the IS_FRAGMENT flag
       set.

   3.  All fragments MUST be sent as *RELIABLE*.

   4.  The receiver MUST buffer fragments until all Total Frags are
       received before reassembling and processing the message.

6.  Command Definitions

   The following Command IDs are reserved.

6.1.  Management (Reliable)

   *  *0x01 (REQ_LOGIN):* Client requests connection.  Payload: { char
      username[32]; uint32_t version; }

   *  *0x02 (RES_LOGIN):* Server response.  Payload: { uint8_t success;
      uint32_t playerId; }

   *  *0x03 (REQ_JOIN_ROOM):* Client joins a lobby.  Payload: { uint32_t
      roomId; }

   *  *0x04 (RES_ROOM_STATE):* Room info.

6.2.  Gameplay (Unreliable)

   *  *0x10 (C_INPUT):* Client input state.  Payload: { uint8_t
      inputMask; } (Bitmask: Up, Down, Left, Right, Shoot).

   *  *0x11 (S_ENTITY_STATE):* World update.  Uses coordinate
      quantization.

      -  Payload: { uint32_t entityId; uint16_t x; uint16_t y; uint8_t
         type; }

6.3.  Gameplay (Reliable)

   *  *0x20 (S_PLAYER_DEATH):* Notification of entity destruction.

   *  *0x21 (S_SCORE_UPDATE):* Global score change.

7.  Security Considerations

   Implementations MUST adhere to the following security guidelines to
   prevent Denial of Service (DoS) and execution flaws:

   1.  *Buffer Bounds Checking:* The receiver MUST verify that
       bytes_transferred == sizeof(Header) + Header.payloadSize.
       Mismatched sizes MUST result in packet rejection.

   2.  *Max Payload Enforcement:* Any packet indicating a payloadSize >
       1400 bytes MUST be dropped immediately to prevent buffer overflow
       attacks.

   3.  *Magic Number Validation:* The Magic Number check MUST occur
       before any memory allocation or logic processing.

   4.  *Sequence Validation:* The receiver SHOULD discard Reliable
       packets with Sequence ID significantly lower than the last
       processed ID to prevent Replay Attacks.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.  The protocol operates on a user-
   defined UDP port (Default: 4242).
