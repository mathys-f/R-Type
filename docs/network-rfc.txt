                    Network RFC for R-Type Protocol
                         draft-pintard-rtype-00

Abstract

   This document describes the R-Type Protocol (RTP), a custom binary
   application-layer protocol designed for real-time multiplayer gaming.
   RTP provides a hybrid reliability model over UDP, supporting both
   unreliable high-frequency state updates and reliable control messages
   through a custom acknowledgment system.  This document defines the
   packet structure, serialization rules, reliability mechanisms, and
   command definitions required for interoperability between Client and
   Server implementation.

1.  Introduction

   The R-Type project requires a high-performance networking
   architecture capable of handling fast-paced arcade gameplay.
   Standard TCP implementations introduce Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking
   and Nagle’s algorithm delays, which are unsuitable for real-time
   entity synchronization.

   The R-Type Protocol (RTP) is designed to run exclusively over UDP
   (User Datagram Protocol).  To mitigate the inherent unreliability of
   UDP, RTP implements a lightweight application-layer reliability
   mechanism (RUDP) for critical data, while allowing transient game
   state data to remain unreliable for maximum throughput.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Data Representation

2.1.  Byte Ordering

   All multi-byte numeric fields (uint16, uint32, float) MUST be
   serialized in *Little Endian* byte order.  This decision aligns with
   the native architecture of modern gaming platforms (x86_64 and
   ARM64), facilitating "Zero-Copy" deserialization strategies.

2.2.  Structure Alignment

   All data structures transmitted over the network MUST be packed with
   1-byte alignment (#pragma pack(1)) to prevent compiler-inserted
   padding bytes from altering the packet size.

3.  Protocol Header Structure

   Every UDP datagram transmitted by either Client or Server MUST begin
   with the following 20-byte fixed header.

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

3.1.  Field Definitions

   *  *Magic Number (16 bits):* MUST be 0xD1CE.  This serves as a
      protocol identifier and a sanity check against random network
      noise.  Packets with invalid magic numbers MUST be dropped
      immediately.

   *  *Command ID (8 bits):* Identifies the type of payload (e.g.,
      Login, Move, Shoot).

   *  *Flags (8 bits):* A bitmask defining packet behavior.  Each flag
      occupies a distinct bit; multiple flags MAY be combined using
      bitwise OR.

      -  0x01 (RELIABLE): The receiver MUST send an acknowledgment (see
         Reliability Mechanism).

      -  0x02 (IS_FRAGMENT): The payload is part of a larger message and
         carries fragment fields.

      -  0x04 (IS_ACK): The packet is an explicit acknowledgment;
         payload SHOULD be empty.

      -  0x08 (IS_ERROR): The packet indicates an error condition.  The
         payload contains an error code and human-readable message.

   *  *Sequence ID (32 bits):* A monotonic counter incremented by the
      sender for every new packet.  Used for ordering and loss
      detection.

   *  *Ack ID (32 bits):* The Sequence ID of the last valid reliable
      packet received by the sender.

   *  *Fragment ID (16 bits):* A unique identifier grouping fragmented
      chunks.

   *  *Frag Index (8 bits):* The current chunk index (0 to N).

   *  *Total Frags (8 bits):* The total number of chunks.

   *  *Payload Size (16 bits):* The size of the data following the
      header, in bytes.

   *  *Checksum (16 bits):* A checksum covering the entire packet
      (header + payload) for data integrity verification.
      Implementations SHOULD use CRC-16-CCITT (poly=0x1021, init=0xFFFF,
      reflected=false) and MUST set the checksum field to 0 while
      computing it.

4.  Reliability Mechanism

   The protocol implements a selective reliability layer.

4.1.  Unreliable Transmission

   Packets with the RELIABLE flag unset (0) are "Fire-and-Forget".
   These are used for high-frequency data such as Entity Position
   Updates (60Hz).  If such a packet is lost, no action is taken.

4.2.  Reliable Transmission

   Packets with the RELIABLE flag set (bit 0x01) MUST be acknowledged.

   1.  *Sender:* MUST store the packet in a "Sent Queue" with a
       timestamp and track retransmission attempts.

   2.  *Receiver:* Upon receiving a Reliable packet, the receiver SHOULD
       either:

       *  piggyback the Ack ID (highest contiguous Sequence ID received)
          in the header of any outgoing packet to that peer, or

       *  send an explicit ACK packet (set IS_ACK flag and CommandID =
          ACK (0xFF)) containing the Ack ID of the received packet.
          Piggybacking is preferred for efficiency; explicit ACKs are
          allowed when no outgoing packet can carry the Ack ID promptly.

   3.  *Ack semantics:* Ack ID in the header is interpreted as a
       cumulative ACK: it acknowledges all reliable packets with
       Sequence ID <= Ack ID.  Implementations MAY include selective-
       acknowledgment (SACK) extensions in a control payload for finer-
       grained loss reporting.

   4.  *Retransmission / RTO:* Implementations SHOULD measure RTT from
       reliable packet/ACK exchanges and compute a retransmission
       timeout (RTO) using a standard algorithm (e.g., TCP's SRTT/RTO
       calculation).  An implementation MAY start with a conservative
       initial RTO of 200ms, but MUST apply exponential backoff on
       repeated retransmissions (RTO *= 2) and SHOULD jitter timers to
       avoid synchronization.  Implementations MUST cap retransmission
       attempts (RECOMMENDED default: 5 attempts).  If no ACK is
       received after the maximum retries, the sender SHOULD consider
       the peer unreachable and close the session.

   5.  *Congestion & pacing:* Because RTP runs over UDP, implementations
       MUST avoid aggressive retransmission that could exacerbate
       congestion.  A simple send-pacing or token-bucket rate limiter
       for retransmissions is RECOMMENDED.

5.  Fragmentation

   The Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) safe limit is defined as *1400
   bytes*. Payloads exceeding this size MUST be fragmented.

   1.  The Payload Size field is the size of this packet's payload only
       (not the total message length).

   2.  The payload SHOULD be split into fragment payloads of size equal
       to the session's negotiated effective_fragment_size (see
       REQ_LOGIN/RES_LOGIN).  If no negotiation occurs, implementations
       SHOULD use the default application fragment payload of *1004
       bytes*. Implementations MUST ensure the chosen fragment payload
       does not exceed the path-MTU-derived limit (MTU - header_size) to
       avoid IP fragmentation; using the document's conservative MTU
       assumption (1400) yields an upper bound of 1400 - 20 = 1380 bytes
       per fragment payload.  Implementations MAY choose a slightly
       smaller fragment payload to allow for additional lower-layer
       headers.

   3.  Each fragment packet MUST set the IS_FRAGMENT flag and populate
       Fragment ID, Frag Index and Total Frags.

   4.  All fragments of a logical message MUST be sent as *RELIABLE*.

   5.  *Reassembly limits & timeouts:* The receiver MUST validate Frag
       Index < Total Frags and SHOULD impose limits to mitigate resource
       exhaustion: a recommended MAX_FRAGS_PER_MESSAGE = 256, per-
       message reassembly timeout FRAGMENT_REASSEMBLY_TIMEOUT = 5s, and
       per-sender reassembly memory cap (RECOMMENDED default: 1 MiB).
       Partially received fragment sets MUST be discarded after timeout
       or when resource caps are exceeded.

   6.  *Fragment ID lifetime:* Fragment ID is a 16-bit identifier scoped
       to the sender; implementations MUST avoid reusing a given
       Fragment ID for new fragmented messages while an older reassembly
       for that ID could still be in progress (recommendation: reuse
       only after FRAGMENT_REUSE_DELAY = 60s or after wrap-around
       detection).

   7.  The receiver MUST buffer fragments until all Total Frags are
       received before reassembling and processing the message.
       Reassembly MUST include validation using the per-packet checksum
       and, optionally, a message-level checksum supplied in the first
       fragment's payload for large messages.

   *  *Default (recommended):* For broad compatibility and efficient
      buffer pooling, RTP RECOMMENDS a default application fragment
      payload of *1004 bytes*. This corresponds to a UDP target payload
      of *1024 bytes* (2^10) and leaves room for the 20-byte RTP header
      (app_fragment = UDP_target_payload - header_size => 1024 - 20 =
      1004).  Choosing 1024 as the UDP target payload produces power-of-
      two friendly buffers while staying well below common MTU limits to
      avoid IP fragmentation on most Internet paths.

   *  *Alternative safe values:* Implementations may prefer a larger UDP
      target payload (e.g., 1200 → app_fragment 1180, or 1400 →
      app_fragment 1380) for higher throughput in controlled networks;
      however, these are not power-of-two and may risk fragmentation on
      narrow-path MTUs.

   *  *Negotiation:* To allow endpoints to select an appropriate
      fragment payload for their deployment, RTP supports optional
      fragment-size negotiation during login (see REQ_LOGIN/RES_LOGIN
      below).  Servers MUST select an effective_fragment_size that does
      not exceed their configured per-packet limit and SHOULD choose a
      conservative value when interacting with unknown networks.

   Formula: app_fragment = UDP_target_payload - header_size (header_size
   = 20).

6.  Command Definitions

   The following Command IDs are reserved.

6.1.  Management (Reliable)

   *  *0x01 (REQ_LOGIN):* Client requests connection.  Payload: {
      uint8_t username_len; char username[variable]; uint32_t version;
      uint16_t preferred_fragment_size; } where username_len <= 32 and
      username is UTF-8 bytes (not NUL-terminated).
      preferred_fragment_size is optional (set to 0 if not used) and
      expresses the client's preferred application-fragment payload in
      bytes (e.g., 1004).  Use of length-prefixed strings avoids
      ambiguity and buffer overrun risks.

   *  *0x02 (RES_LOGIN):* Server response.  Payload: { uint8_t success;
      uint32_t playerId; uint16_t effective_fragment_size; } where
      effective_fragment_size is the per-packet application-fragment
      payload the server agrees to use for this session (e.g., 1004).
      If success == 0, the effective_fragment_size MAY be set to 0.

   *  *0x03 (REQ_JOIN_ROOM):* Client joins a lobby.  Payload: { uint32_t
      roomId; }

   *  *0x04 (RES_ROOM_STATE):* Room info.

6.2.  Gameplay (Unreliable)

   *  *0x10 (C_INPUT):* Client input state.  Payload: { uint8_t
      inputMask; } (Bitmask: Up, Down, Left, Right, Shoot).

   *  *0x11 (S_ENTITY_STATE):* World update.  Uses coordinate
      quantization.

      -  Payload: { uint32_t entityId; uint16_t x; uint16_t y; uint8_t
         type; }

6.3.  Gameplay (Reliable)

   *  *0x20 (S_PLAYER_DEATH):* Notification of entity destruction.

   *  *0x21 (S_SCORE_UPDATE):* Global score change.

7.  Security Considerations

   Implementations MUST adhere to the following security and operational
   guidelines to prevent Denial of Service (DoS), replay, and resource
   exhaustion attacks:

   1.   *Magic Number Validation:* The Magic Number check MUST occur
        immediately upon packet receipt and before any memory allocation
        or further processing.  Packets with invalid magic numbers MUST
        be dropped.

   2.   *Buffer Bounds Checking:* The receiver MUST verify that
        bytes_transferred == sizeof(Header) + Header.payloadSize.
        Mismatched sizes MUST result in immediate packet rejection with
        no further processing.

   3.   *Max Payload Enforcement:* Any packet indicating a payloadSize >
        1400 bytes MUST be dropped immediately to prevent buffer
        overflow attacks.  For fragmented messages, the per-packet
        payloadSize MUST still respect this limit.

   4.   *Sequence Validation & Replay Protection:* The receiver SHOULD
        discard reliable packets with Sequence ID significantly lower
        than the last processed ID.  Implementations MUST define a clear
        sequence-number comparison (see Recommendations): for 32-bit
        sequence numbers, treat a sequence s1 as newer than s2 if (s1 -
        s2) mod 2^32 < 2^31.

Internet-Draft                   R-Type                    November 2025


   5.   *Rate Limiting & Resource Caps:* Servers MUST apply per-client
        rate limits for incoming packets and a per-client resource cap
        for buffered/reassembled fragments (recommendation: 1 MiB).
        Excessive or malformed traffic SHOULD be dropped and, when
        abusive, result in temporary throttling or disconnection.

   6.   *Fragmentation DoS Mitigations:* Limit the number of
        simultaneous incomplete fragment reassemblies per client
        (RECOMMENDED default: 8) and enforce
        FRAGMENT_REASSEMBLY_TIMEOUT.  Reject new fragmented streams when
        resource quotas are exhausted.

   7.   *Retransmission & Backoff:* As noted in the Reliability section,
        implementations MUST cap retransmission attempts and apply
        exponential backoff to avoid retransmit storms that amplify
        congestion.

   8.   *Handshake & Authentication:* Implementations SHOULD perform a
        handshake (e.g., REQ_LOGIN/RES_LOGIN) before allocating
        significant state for a client.  Servers SHOULD issue a short-
        lived session token on successful login and require that token
        in subsequent sensitive control messages.  For stronger
        security, use authenticated cryptographic tokens and negotiate
        an HMAC key for packet authentication.

   9.   *Integrity / Authentication:* CRC checks detect accidental
        corruption but do not prevent malicious tampering.

   10.  *NAT Traversal & Keepalive:* Because RTP runs over UDP, clients
        SHOULD send periodic keepalive/ping packets (RECOMMENDED
        interval: 15s) to maintain NAT mappings.  Servers SHOULD drop
        idle sessions after a configurable idle timeout (RECOMMENDED
        default: 60s) unless keepalives are observed.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.  The protocol operates on a user-
   defined UDP port (Default: 8080).
